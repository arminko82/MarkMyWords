# MarkMyWords
By Armin Koefler, 29.09.2017

A chrome extension for highlighting all occurrences of the currently selected word(s).

Notes:
* The ingenious project name has been created by Stefan
* The skeleton of the project is based on https://github.com/masarakki/chrome-extension-skelton
* Due to inexpected higher complexity of the js code further development will be based on TDD (https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/gentle-introduction-to-javascript-tdd-intro/).
